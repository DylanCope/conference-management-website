Project spec.

We are working on website to help my lab manage its conference submissions.
The UI for the website should have a simple, Google forms like appearance. Nothing too fancy, just clean and simple.

We are going to start the project by implementing the following functions:

When you land on the site you enter your email to get access (no password needed).

If your email is in a list of admins, you can access an admin page for managing the existing conferences that we are aiming for. We need functionality to create a new conference. This involves data entry for the name and dates for the conference (abstract submission, full submission, and conference date), as well as a link to the conference website.

A submissions registration page, accessible to anyone in the lab. Here you can manage your submissions. Creating a new submission just requires giving a title. Then it appears in the list of your submissions. If you click on the submission, it takes you to a page for the submission where you can add more details. For now, just the first authors, senior authors, and a link to the overleaf.
