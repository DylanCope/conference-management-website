This workspace contains a Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind scaffold for a small conference submissions manager used by a lab.

Guidance for Copilot:
- Prefer simple, accessible UI patterns resembling Google Forms.
- Use Prisma + SQLite for a minimal local database.
- Implement email-only login creating a session cookie; seed an admin email list in Prisma seed.
- Keep pages minimal and well-typed with TypeScript.
